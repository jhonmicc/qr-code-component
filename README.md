## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

```css
.body {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I don't do development continuously

### Useful resources

- (https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helped me for some error solution. I really liked this source and will use it going forward.
- (https://www.youtube.com) - This is an video tutorial which helped me finally understand flex especiall how to centering a box. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
